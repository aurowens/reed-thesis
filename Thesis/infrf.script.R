#####  Imma have to write my own random forest code, y'all 
rf <- function(form, data) { 
  #imputs: formula to be tested and the dataset to test on. outputs: tribble,
  #contains: total oob error, every tree
}

#then infrf is simply calls to inftrees, repeated. Produces a p-val from distribution of values from the rf
