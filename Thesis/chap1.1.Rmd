#Random Forests: a description

A random forest $R_f$ is the set of functions $T_1,...,T_N$ where each $T_j$ is a piece-wise function from the sample space $\Omega$ to the response space $\Phi$. In general, $\Omega$ is defined by an n x p matrix where each column is a random variable and $\Phi$ is defined by an n x 1 vector $Y$. 

Each tree $T_j$ is generated on a subset of both $\Omega$ and $\Phi$ called the training set. It is then tested on a disjoint subset of $\Omega$ called the test set and the values of $T_j$ on this test set are called the predictions.
