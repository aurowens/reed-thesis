### Research Log

This week I am following the paper trail from Breiman's 2001 paper, *Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures*, to find if anyone has expanded upon inferential statistics using random forests since this paper. 

There seems to have been a lot of work done on this issue since the 2001 paper by Breiman and Cutler, from Berekely, and Strobl et al in Munich. Some possible areas for me to explore are:

- Strobl's conditional variable importance algorithm is really, really slow and potentially open for improvement.

- I'm still unsure if Strobl answers my quesiton, are the important variables in a RF consistant with the "important" variables from let's say logistic regression? Let's run some code to get an intuition about this

For next week, I plan to: continue reading papers in this dialogue and implement the five methods described in the papers read this week for variable importance.
